# â˜• 404 CafÃ© â€“ The Error Page That Serves Coffee & Quirks

Welcome to the **404 CafÃ©** â€” a cozy, interactive 404 error page where users who lose their way are greeted by a friendly pixel barista, not a boring "Page Not Found" message.

This project turns your error page into a mini experience with jokes, directions, and coffee-themed charm.

(You can link your hosted page here, e.g., GitHub Pages or Netlify.)
If you're using a server (like Node.js, Apache, or Nginx), configure your 404 error page to point to index.html.
